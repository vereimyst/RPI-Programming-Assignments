# RPI-Programming-Assignments

Maybe upload class homework assignments from Computer Science I (Fall 2021) and Data Structures (Spring 2022)â€¦ RPI programming stuffs in general? So those classes to start I guess xd

Either way, I need to get more familiar with GitHub, so we'll see how this goes! (Wow learning a lot already.. it's been like 2 hrs of messing around and I have a headache)


## Folder for CS1 - Fall of 2021

Obviously... but also i still don't know how to make things temporarily private or only public after a date or time or whatever so... still gotta find out if you can or not xd

Not allowed to post until at least the end of the course. Even then, they don't support it very much since they like to reuse questions. If projects get a little bigger, I may make it public (in accordance to course policies of course). Otherwise, contact me for access... Note: I do not endorse Academic Dishonesty in any way (following the definition of the RPI standards). Thus, I might or might not send it your way even if you do reach out :)
