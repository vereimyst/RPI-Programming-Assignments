# RPI-Programming-Assignments

Maybe upload class homework assignments from Computer Science I (Fall 2021) and Data Structures (Spring 2022)â€¦ RPI programming stuffs in general? So those classes to start I guess xd

Either way, I need to get more familiar with GitHub, so we'll see how this goes! (Wow learning a lot already.. it's been like 2 hrs of messing around and I have a headache)
