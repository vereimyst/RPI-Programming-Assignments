# RPI-Programming-Assignments

Maybe upload class assignmentsâ€¦ RPI programming stuffs in general...

Not allowed to publicize the code until at least the end of the course. Even then, they don't support it very much since they like to reuse questions. If projects get a little bigger, I may make it public (in accordance to course policies of course). Contact me for access... I do not endorse Academic Dishonesty in any way, following the definition of the RPI standards in particular. Additionally, because of these policies I actually put uploading all my code on hiatus. As such, I still have all the code I wrote, but I don't have all the documentation involving homework requirements. Uploads will likely be ad hoc.

# Previous courses
 - Computer Science 1 (Fall 2021) -- hws 1-8 already on Github (private)
 - Data Structures (Data Structures 2022)

Currently taking Foundations of Computer Science, which apparently doesn't involve any coding (and is basically just Discrete Math).
