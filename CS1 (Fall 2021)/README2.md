# Folder for CS1 - Fall of 2021

Obviously... but also i still don't know how to make things temporarily private or only public after a date or time or whatever so... still a struggle.

If I do end up learning how to do that, I can only make it public 2 days after each due date earliest (actually not sure if there are other terms for showing classwork... I should find out)

Anyhow, if I am allowed to post that stuff after due dates, then I probably will... if I remember. Take these things that you can't access for now :)
