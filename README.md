# RPI-Programming-Assignments

Maybe upload class homework assignments from Computer Science I (Fall 2021) and Data Structures (Spring 2022)â€¦ 
If I do end up doing that, I can only make it public 2 days after each due date earliest (not sure if there are other terms for showing classwork... I should find out)

Either way, I need to get more familiar with GitHub, so we'll see how this goes! (Wow learning a lot already.. it's been like 2 hrs of messing around and I have a headache)
